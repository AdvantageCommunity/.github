   ```

**Make Changes:** Make the necessary changes or improvements to the codebase on your local machine.

**Commit and Push:** Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit them to your local repository and push them to your GitHub fork:

   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push
   ```

**Submit a Pull Request:** Go to the original repository on GitHub and click on the "Pull Request" button. Provide a descriptive title and explanation of your changes. Once submitted, your pull request will be reviewed by the project maintainers.
